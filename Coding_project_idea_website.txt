Coding project idea: website name? "Bear's Waiting Room"
Problem to solve: I want one place to go to access the multiple things of the internet I access
daily to minimize how much clicking I have to do
Make a website with links to all the sites that I love reading articles or forum posts on
Maybe make an areamap to my favorite YouTube subscribes I like to watch? 1 square, 4
quadrants with my Top 4 YouTubers
A drop down menu to gauge how I'm feeling in the morning and in the evening?
A form instead?
